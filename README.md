<h3>Overall Profit Performance:</h3>

The total profit is reported as $468.64 million, with a profit percentage of 1%, indicating slim margins, possibly due to high costs or competitive pricing.

<h3>Monthly and Weekly Sales Patterns:</h3>

Weekday sales appear higher compared to weekends, with a noticeable increase towards the end of the week (Fridays), especially in months like June.

<h3>Product Category Insights:</h3>

The pie chart "Products sold in a month" displays the distribution of products sold. Coffee-related items (Coffee, Coffee Beans, Drinking Chocolate) make up a significant portion of sales.
Other categories like Tea and Flavours also contribute but at a lower rate, suggesting core product focus on coffee and related items.

<h3>Location-Based Sales Analysis:</h3>

The bar chart "Product sold in different Locations" highlights sales performance across various locations, with Coffee being the highest-selling product in all areas, especially in Lower Manhattan.
Other products like Branded and Bakery items also show noticeable sales in Astoria, indicating regional preferences.

<h3>Sales Trends by Hour:</h3>

The line chart "Quantity vs hours" shows the sales quantity across different hours of the day, peaking during morning hours (8-11 AM) which aligns with typical coffee consumption times.
Sales taper off significantly in the late afternoon and evening, reflecting reduced customer demand for coffee products during these hours.
